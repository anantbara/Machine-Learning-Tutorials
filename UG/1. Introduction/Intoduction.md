# Introduction

In last tutorial, we have seen the very first and most important step before actually working on Machine Learning i.e. [Data Preparation](https://github.com/anantbara/Machine-Learning-Tutorials/blob/master/UG/1.%20Data_Preparation/Data%20Preparation.md). Now we are going to explore and experience the power of Machine Learning. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. The iterative aspect of machine learning is important because as models are exposed to new data, they are able to independently adapt. They learn from previous computations to produce reliable, repeatable decisions and results. 

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1) Supervised Learning
* In a given example, the input and its corresponding output is also given.
* Denoted by (x,y) where x=input and y=output/label

### 2) Unsupervised Learning
* Output is unknown for each given input
* Input data is clustered/grouped based on their structure/pattern similarity.

### 3) Reinforcement Learning
* Determine what to do based on rewards and punishments.

### 4) Semi-supervised Learning
* Combination of both Supervised and Unsupervised Learning.
